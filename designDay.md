### Braindump 
__Themes__
* __Social Media__
* __Training__
Reputation of training is amazing. Really in depth and well structured. Can always expand
* __Data__
* __Comms__ 
Challenge for AVA - no comms officer so big barrier. Doing amazing work, but how do they get it out there?
* __Funding__
Such short deadlines and turn around. Very challenging with such a small staff team
* __Partnerships__
Pitted against one another which means hard to know who the best people to collaborate with are
* __People__
Not enought time... All really bright etc. but can feel overwhelming
* __Policy__
* __Sector__
In compeition with rest of sector. Men & VAWG (violence against women and girls) 
* __Time__
* __Research__
In order to influence policy
* __Expansion__

### Goals, Stakeholders, Product, Inspiration

- Training focus: finding out about training and recieve certificate after training. Stakeholder young girls. Currently use Twitter
- View from boardmember: Goal to get more people involved. stakeholders are schools (do a lot of work in schools already), universities, politicians and men who feel they can't contribute. Inspiration is health service and youth offending team
- Main goal to be clear about what AVA want to achieve and then portraying that externally. e.g. when people come to website to understand where people should go. (they have 4 different websites at the moment, e-learning, ccrm, main website). Started off the back of projects but then afterwards have no capacity/time to maintain them. At the moment work to improve training and admin of main website. 
- Leaning and development: Enable front line professionals to do their job better. Front line professionals and bodies that educate people. Currently do traububg and policy/campaign work. Currently a bit stagnant - want to be a learning and development specialist. More input from survivors? Stories not heard outside the sector. Could do more than just training - need to take it a step further. Training that leads to positive, inspiring change. 
- from a comms perspective and finance: have a national media profile - known within sector as leading experts in field but not broader. Currently limited to Twitter, could they have a wider social media page? Break out from the sector and get everyone knowing who AVA are. stakeholders: auditors, politicans, journalists. Already looking at auditing social media & website to look at trends and see what's working. And doing Twitter very well. Inspirational overview: field & flower (ethical farming). How do we keep a live organisation with relationships
- org issues & perceptions: Lots of miss information and back lash that "it doesn't exist" or "what about men?". These arguments break down the progress that is made - how do we change opinions. Majority of perpotrators are men. Inspiration - UN campaign 'he for she' and movember (creates a truth around a certain issue. Using something fun and positive to create change on serious issue), #metoo
- Keeping track of partnerships. A lot of information about who people are partnering with is not documented. How do we keep up these relationships?

## Design :art: 
### Crazy 8's & Storyboarding 
> “I want to do something, how can I help?”

Survivors being able to share their stories
These stories can influence policy - the DV bill vote as a good call to action
Clear closing statement and signposting of state

[ Survivors whose stories influence policy often have skills and advantages that don't always make them representative of the entire group. The people who are able to do public speaking easily, for example, who have a certain level of education, would be more likely to be taken into spaces where policy decisions are being made ]
 
---
Feeling part of a group + community
Meeting new people
Social media access

---
Two ways to access the rest of the content, learning to heal
signposting to different agencies and support networks

---
Safety needs to be at the centre of what we build
Ensuring safety for campaigning survivors
Covert app, e.g. escape button - to hide

---
Postcode finder
What networks are available, how can I volunteer, what access to free workshops do I have?
Where are the local support networks?
Where are the local training opportunities?

Utilising lists of pre-existing resources from the website

---
The latter stage of the healing process can be helping other people
Creating template letters to allow survivors get involved in anti VAWG sector work, to lobby MPs, etc
How professionals might use this, putting survivors into contact with charity sector workers in a meaningful way
