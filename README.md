## The Challenge :punch:

AVA have a number of challenges, including: Social Media, Training Reputation, Data, Comms, funding, Partnerships, time, research and expansion!

We spent the morning exploring each of these challenges before narrowing the scope to a single problem statement.

After silent voting and a number of discussions the final problem statement was decided upon:

>*Kate needs a way to have influence so that she can feel like she can make change*



_*Note: all design workshop notes can be found [here](https://github.com/InFact-coop/AVA/blob/staging/designDay.md)*_

## Our Solution? :bulb: 

**AVA Expert By Experience** 

> A way for survivors to share their experience to help influence change for women and girls


 **The aims of the solution**
* To allow survivors to share their story and send a message to government
* To give survivors a chance to share their journey
* To help survivors feel like they can turn their situation into a positive change
* To help AVA gather unbiased data of suffering women to help their in bidding for funders and influencing policy


### Process :clipboard:


__Prototype__  
We then created static designs using an online tool called Figma. This allowed us to map the rough user journey and provide us with a chance to have rapid feedback on the designs prior to building the product with code. 

Below are the designs created _*(note: the final designs have changed since these)*_

> As the user enters the app they are greeted with a motivational statement that sets the tone for what they will be doing

> The user will then be presented with useful questions and answers before proceeding to the questions

> The user is then asked questions about their journey

> The user is then asked a specific question about what they would like to ask the government

> The final question page is to collect information about the demographics of the user

> The user is then thanks for their input and provided with links that may be useful

## Further Development  :wrench:
### User Testing :two_women_holding_hands::two_women_holding_hands:
User testing allows you to get feedback from your primary users to check that the product being built fits their needs. This is __very__ important to build a successful product. 

__The three key points for testing are:__
- Have a script which has tasks for them to complete
- Ask for people to give you a commentary of what they are doing, but don't respond to them
- Document their response

__Additional recommendations for _*your*_ user testing:__
* Ask user to complete the flow and explain what they are thinking throughout the process 
    * Make __*lots*__ of notes. It is good to have someone guiding the user and someone note taking so nothing is missed!
    *  Try and gather if the user understands the purpose of the app and if the interactions are intuitive 
    *   Try to understand further if the types, quantity and copy of the questions is appropriate for the audience. 
    *   Does the user feel like this can help make a difference? 
* Users may comment on aesthetics __but__ unless the same comments are brought up several times these comments are __*usually*__ not important. The focus should be on the users interactions and understanding of the product.   

Here are some __useful resources__ to look at when completing your user testing sessions:
-  [Googles Gurilla Testing Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YL0xoSmyZI&feature=youtu.be)
- [Script Guidance and Template](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/user-testing.md#1-planning)
- [Steve Krug user testing script](https://sensible.com/downloads/test-script.pdf)

### Next Sprint :runner: 
If this design is move forward for a build sprint it is important to concentrate on key features that both __*solves the initital problem and implements feedback from user testing*__.

Our current recommendations for an initial sprint would be:
* Implement feedback from user testing 
* To make the product useable on larger screen sizes 
* Improve accessibility - Product is currently not useable for people with hearing or visual impairments 
* Button to call for help if user says that they are 'currently' being abused 
* Back end! 

> This would be formally decided following the user testing and during a sprint planning meeting :+1: 

### Product Feedback :arrows_counterclockwise:

* Very interested in applying for Comic Relief Fund
